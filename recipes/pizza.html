    <p><strong>Neapolitan pizza</strong>(Italian: <i>pizza</i> napoletana; Neapolitan: pizza napulitana) 
        is the version of the round pizza typically prepared in the Italian city 
        of Naples and characterised by a soft, thin dough with high edges.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>fresh mozzarella</li>
        <li>fresh basil</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make authentic Neapolitan pizza, get your mixing bowl, pour in 600ml of water and add 30g salt.</li>
        <li>Mix this well using your hand to help dissolve the salt.</li>
        <li>Add 100g (10% flour) to the water and mix it through with your hands until the flour dissolves. This will result in a crepe/pancake consistency.</li>
        <li>Next, add the yeast to the mix helping it to quickly melt in the water using your fingers an mix through with your hand again.</li>
        <li>Now, the important part, add the 5 Stagioni Neapolitan Flour using one hand, a small amount at a time, not all at once and mix with your other hand as you go</li>
        <li>Once the dough has started to come together really well, flip it out on to a bench and start to knead it with both hands absorbing all the remaining flour.</li>
        <li>Keep working the dough until you find it has come together and has a smooth consistency.</li>
    </ol>
